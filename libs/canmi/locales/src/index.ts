 * which is which. Only the pair that needs telling apart carries a qualifier: there is one English
 * here and two Chinese, and each is written in its own script.
 *
 * The site's language picker was the first consumer and the desktop client's segment view was
 * the second, which is what moved this out of `apps/site/src/lib/locale/switcher.ts`. That client
 * is archived and the surface replacing it inherits the same need, so the move still stands.
