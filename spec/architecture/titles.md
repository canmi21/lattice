# Titles: the full one for a first load, the short one for a known reader

**A page has two titles: the full one a search result shows, and the short one a tab shows.** The
full one leads with the name and then says, in plain words, what the page is; the short one is the
name alone. A crawler gets the full one and a reader who has been here before gets the short one.

| Page          | Full                                                 | Short          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| site, home    | `Canmi - Notes on the software and hardware I build` | `Canmi`        |
| site, article | `<title>: <subtitle>`                                | `<title>`      |
| status        | `Canmi Status - Is everything up right now`          | `Canmi Status` |

The home's two halves are `title` and `subtitle` in `contents/homepage.md`. Every other page keeps
the one title it had. `og:title` is the full one where the page has one, the article's title alone
where it does not.

## Which one a load shows

- **A page loaded fresh in a browser this app has no mark in shows the full title**, and the
  server renders it. Then it marks the browser: `visit.seen` in the `reader` record, see
  [engagement.md](../engagement.md), "What this site remembers is two records and one mechanism".
- **A page loaded fresh where the mark is shows the short title once it has hydrated.**
- **A page reached by a navigation inside the app shows the short title.** Only the landing page
  of a first visit is the full one.

`@canmi/behavior` holds both halves: `brevity` decides, and `title.svelte` renders the page's
`<title>` from it. Each app's root layout settles it on mount, and the site's `afterNavigate`
shortens it on any navigation that is not the first.

## Why this and not something else

**Google renders JavaScript, on every page, and reads a title the script changed.** Shortening
every title after hydration would put the short one in the results, and nothing in a page can ask
Google not to render it.

**Its renderer keeps no state between loads**: storage and cookies are cleared for each URL it
renders, and it loads each URL fresh rather than following a link inside the app. So it always
sees what a first-time reader sees, which is the full title. That is also why this is not
cloaking: no visitor is told apart by who it is, only by what its own browser holds, and Google is
shown exactly what any new reader is shown. Telling crawlers apart by user agent or by automation
traits is the alternative not taken -- it is cloaking by definition, and the traits do not even
mark Google's renderer reliably.

A browser that keeps nothing -- a private window, storage turned off, data cleared -- is always a
first visit and always shows the full title. Nothing breaks; the title is just longer.
